# My Awesome Project
A simple to-do list that can be marked completed or completely deleted.

**Link to project:** https://react-todo-five-opal.vercel.app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, Vite, TailwindCSS

## Lessons Learned:

This was a new kind of to-do project for me. Not only did I do it in ReactJS, but I was able to give it some more functionality than some older attempts at doing a to-do app. The user can delete the task completely, or they can mark it as completed and it gets moved to the completed list down below. This was huge for me because I was able to not only change state but move it around to a different location. At some point, I would like to add a little more functionality of using local storage and then deleting completed tasks after the day is finished. This may require rebuilding this project from task.
